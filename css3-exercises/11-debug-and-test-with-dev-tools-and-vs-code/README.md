# Exercise 11. Debug and Test with Dev Tools and VS Code

**Scenario:** Some users report layout breaking on smaller screens.

**Objective:** Use DevTools to test styles and debug.

## Tasks

- **Use Chrome's device toolbar** to simulate different screen sizes:
  1. Open your HTML file in Chrome.
  2. Press `F12` or right-click and choose "Inspect" to open DevTools.
  3. Click the device toolbar icon (top left of DevTools) to toggle device emulation.
  4. Select different devices or set custom screen sizes to test responsiveness.

- **Inspect applied styles and test different values live:**
  1. Use the "Elements" tab to select any element.
  2. In the "Styles" pane, view and edit CSS properties live.
  3. Try changing values (e.g., font-size, margin) and see the effect immediately.

- **Use the Network tab to check if the external CSS is loaded:**
  1. Go to the "Network" tab in DevTools.
  2. Reload the page.
  3. Look for your CSS file in the list to confirm it loaded successfully.

You can also use VS Code's Live Server extension for real-time preview and quick reloads while editing your HTML and CSS files.
